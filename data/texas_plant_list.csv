Native habitat: ledges along rivers, thickets and groves, along arroyos on the Edwards Plateau and in South Texas. There are many cultivars, which are not covered here. Propagation: seed, cutting.","Blooms May-October. It has a bush-like form but is not woody. In the absence of frost it can grow as perennial. Leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with smooth margins. Flowers are star- or bell-shaped with 4–5 petals, usually solitary but can sometimes occur in small clusters.  The fruit is a small round to oval berry that turns from green to red.

Propagation: seed, softwood cutting, semi-hardwood cutting, hardwood cutting, sucker cutting.","Blooms April-July. A clumping shrub or thicket forming small tree with reddish brown or gray branchlets. Leaves are oval with upper surface slightly rough, and lower surface velvety. Small white flowers occur in broad clusters at the ends of branches, followed by hard, white fruit. Provides cover for wildlife. An important source of food for fall migrating bird species.","1) Griffith, Bryce, Omernick & Rodgers (2007).

It can be found in most soil types, but is most often found on silty loams or sandy substrates. Typical habitat includes dry plains, prairies, hillsides, open woodlands, sandhills, and roadsides. It occurs on dry and moist sites. Due to its deep taproot, it is able to persist in areas where other shallow-rooted species cannot. Similar appearance to Dalea compacta, but its native habitat is further west. The Dalea species more commonly grown commercially. Propagation: seed.","Blooms June-September. Grows in clumps of stiff, upright stems. Leaves are a few centimeters long and finely divided into 3 to 7 leaflets. Flowers are clustered in a thimble-shaped arrangement which blooms from the bottom to the top. The fruit is a legume pod that contains one or two seeds.

Low growing form. The common name elephant's foot refers to the large basal leaves of this species. Bloom consists of many small white to purple flower heads arranged in clusters. Although a member of the composite family, the flowers of elephant's foot are not daisy-like in appearance because each flower head contains only disc flowers. The fruit is a cypsela: a dry, one-seeded fruit, usually topped by pappus.","1) https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=ELCA3; 2) https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=37297#null; 3) http://bonap.net/TDC/Image/Map?taxonType=Species&taxonId=2792&locationType=County&mapType=Normal; 4) https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?taxonid=277426&isprofile=0&n=1; 5) http://coastalplainplants.org/wiki/index.php/Elephantopus_carolinianus, 6) https://mowildflowers.net/elephantopus-carolinianus--carolina-elephants-foot-1/"

Set up a pond or a water collection tank near a downspout to supplement water. Propagation: clump division.","Common scouring rush is a spreading, reed-like plant. The stems are cylindrical, jointed, hollow, usually unbranched, and have rough longitudinal ridges. The tiny leaves are joined together around the stem, forming a narrow black-green band or sheath at each joint. Like other ferns and their relatives, scouring rush does not produce flowers or seeds. Reproduces by spores. The fruit is a cone. Horsetail Rush provides great cover for wetland birds, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians. aquatic insects will feed on the decayed plant matter.

Ocotillo is a spiny shrub with many long, unbranched green stems growing from the base. Leaves are oval to oblong, with tips rounded or notched. Ocotillos are drought-deciduous plants. They drop their leaves quickly in times of prolonged drought or stress. The name Ocotillo means ""little pine"" in Mexican Spanish. Like a pine (ocote), its stalks produce a resin.

The fruit is a round, smooth, shiny brown capsule.","1) https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=29214#null, 2) https://bonap.net/TDC/Image/Map?taxonType=Species&taxonId=14106&locationType=County&mapType=Normal, 3) https://portal.torcherbaria.org/portal/taxa/index.php?taxon=Linum+lewisii&formsubmit=Search+Terms, 4) https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=LILE3, 5) https://www.gardenia.net/plant/linum-lewisii, 6) https://butterflybushes.com/products/linum-lewisii-wild-blue-flax, 6) https://findingnectar.com/products/blue-flax#:~:text=Flax%20Blue%2C%20scientifically%20known%20as,blooms%20and%20supporting%20local%20wildlife., 7) https://gardenforwildlife.com/products/blue-flax-plant-sets?srsltid=AfmBOor15p6Y5o5bEIGAAotb_7KNGUIJlFRqOxiQEVmQne9Ofjp2A4Af"

Drought tolerance is high. Does not require any supplemental water once established. It is evergreen in the warmer parts of its range and deciduous in cooler climates.

Propagation: seed, division.","Blooms March-November. Ground-hugging stems may be several feet long. The foliage is bipinnately compound, with tiny leaflets no more than 1/2 inch. As the Latin name implies, the leaves and stems are pubescent - covered by soft hairs. They are also sensitive to touch and fold at night. Small ""powder puff"" heads of bright yellow flowers are produced on stalks along the stems. The fruit is a green, turning brown, flattened pod that splits open to release many small black seeds.

An upright form with lance-shaped to nearly triangular leaves, with a heart-shaped base. Slender, nodding, solitary spikes of tiny, white, fragrant flowers occur opposite a leaf. Produces a dry fruit that splits into single-seeded parts when ripe. Wood ducks and other birds eat the seeds. Turtles and beavers eat the foliage. May also be eaten by livestock but can be toxic in large quantities. Provides habitat for fish and wildlife, including frogs, salamanders, turtles, small fish, aquatic insects, and birds.

A patch of goldenrod can be beautiful addition to your garden if you have the space.

Propagation: seed, softwood cutting.","Blooms April-November. An irregular shaped shrub. Compound leaves are divided into 5–13 elliptic to lanceolate leaflets, with serrated margins, with lighter in color below. Trumpet-shaped, yellow flowers occur in clusters in terminal racemes.

Grows as a shrub or small tree with reddish brown twigs that have a thin light gray coating. Leaves are oval with finely serrated margins and a shiny upper surface. White flowers are arranged in rounded or flattened clusters. The fruit is fleshy, bluish black.","1) Griffith, Bryce, Omernick & Rodgers (2007).

Tolerates a range of soils.  Once established, it is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering. Regular pruning, including removing weak branches and thinning overcrowded areas, is recommended to encourage robust growth. Plant away from high traffic areas due to spiny branches. Frequent in unshaded places with very shallow soil over limestone. Native habitat: near streams and river banks, chaparral and brush country. The dense thickets formed by this species provides wonderful nesting and resting protection for birds, small mammals and lizards. Propagation: seed.","Blooms March-April. Densely branched shrub with small leaves and stiff branchlets ending in spines. Bark with light gray coating interrupted by fine, lengthwise cracks. Leaves in clusters or alternate, with variable shape and serrate or smooth margins. Flowers are inconspicuous, in small clusters. The fruit is fleshy, black, about 3/3 inch in diameter.","1) https://southwestdesertflora.com/WebsiteFolders/All_Species/Rhamnaceae/Ziziphus%20obtusifolia,%20Lotebush.html, 2) https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=28596#null, 3) https://bonap.net/TDC/Image/Map?taxonType=Species&taxonId=21045&locationType=County&mapType=Normal, 4) https://portal.torcherbaria.org/portal/taxa/index.php?taxon=Ziziphus+obtusifolia&formsubmit=Search+Terms, 5) https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=ZIOB, 6) https://www.fs.usda.gov/database/feis/plants/shrub/zizobt/all.html#:~:text=Where%20it%20does%20occur%20in,undisturbed%20%5B19%2C42%5D."
