      "ID: 6 | Latin Name: Acer rubrum var. drummondii | Common Name: Drummond Red Maple | Native Habitat: Woodland, Wetland or Riparian | Growth Form: Tree | Bloom Season: Spring | Bloom Color: Red | Lifespan: Perennial | Wildlife Benefit: Beetles, Butterflies, Birds, Small Mammals, Deer, Moths, Bees | Soil: Sand, Loam, Clay, Calcareous, Poor Drainage, Moist | Light: Sun, Part Shade | Water: Medium, High | Min Height (cm): 1524.0 | Max Height (cm): 2743.2 | Min Spread (cm): 914.4 | Max Spread (cm): 1828.8 | Maintenence: Fast growth rate. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions. A showy shade tree with attractive fall foliage. The fallen leaves decompose over time, releasing essential nutrients back into the soil. This process enriches the surrounding environment, supporting the growth of other plant species and wildlife. Prefers moist, swampy sites and is not as cold hardy as other maples. Propagation: seed. | Comments: Blooms February-April. Forms a dense crown with sturdy branches. Leaves are 3- to 5-lobed, but are different from the other Maples by being hairy on the silvery lower surface of its leaves. Male and female flowers are found on separate trees. In spring the tree is covered with decorative red male flowers. Female trees produce seeds called samaras. The tree's bark provides a habitat for a variety of organisms: beetles and spiders find refuge, creating a miniature ecosystem within the tree itself. Larval host: Sphinx Moths. Although still listed by some in the Aceraceae Family, the majority of botanical organizations now list it in the Sapindaceae Family.\n",
